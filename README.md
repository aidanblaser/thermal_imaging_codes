# thermal_imaging

This is a respository of codes I worked on to unpack thermal drone images, and in doing so calculate temperatures in Celsius, as well as georeferencing each pixel. 

The main code to use is save_Thermal_Pairs.m, which inputs a directory containing the drone JPGs, and calculates its spatial resolution, world temperature, and exports all other data in a .mat file.
